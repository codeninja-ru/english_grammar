When we want to write a letter, we take a piece of paper and a pen. We first write our address and the date in the right-hand corner. Then on the left-hand side we write a greeting. We may write, for instance, "My dear brother," "Dear Henry,'* etc., and then on the next line we begin the real letter. We must not forget to leave a margin on the left-hand side of the page. At the end of the letter we write "Yours," and then we sign our name. We put the letter into an envelope and close the envelope. On the envelope we write the name and address of the person who will receive it. We stick a stamp in the top right-hand corner, and then we post the letter.
