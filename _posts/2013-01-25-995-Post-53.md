On Sunday our family went to the country. We got up at sunrise and quickly had breakfast. After breakfast we left home. There is a little village not far from St. Petersburg where we have friends. We went there by train. We had a very good time in the country. The weather was fine, the sky was blue and the sun was shining. We stayed out of doors all day long. We played volleyball and tennis. We returned to town late in the evening. When we came home, we had supper and went to bed at once.
